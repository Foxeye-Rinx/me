Hi, I am Tomoki Miyauci, a frontend engineer.

I made some services with Typescript and Vue.
I'm also interested in Preact and Svelte. Recently, I am trying to learn functional programming.

Prior to becoming a Web Enginner, I was dealing with foreign exchange at an investment bank.
That's why I still like foreign exchange and especially crypto assets.

I also like traveling, basketball and strength training.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/TomokiMiyauci).
