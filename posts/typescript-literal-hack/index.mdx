title: Define a specific string or all strings in TypeScript
description: This section shows how to define 'string' | string in TypeScript. Normally this would be upcast to type string, but we'll solve this in a hacky way.

## Introduction

In this article, I'll show you a small story.

Maybe you know that TypeScript doesn't allow `'string' | string`.
It gets upcasted and becomes a `string` type.

```ts
type Color = 'red' | string // string
```

The string literal type is a derivative of the primitive type `string`.
Therefore, if you use a union type, it will be upcast.

However, there are many situations, such as library, where you want an interface that accepts a particular string or all strings.

This article will show you how to do that.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we can do the following:

```ts
type Color = 'red' | String
const color1: Color = 'red' // ok
const color2: Color = 'blue' // ok
```

This is what I learned from [chakra-ui's Union types](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/baa6fee280530137548f961db5cb308100bc3920/packages/styled-system/src/utils/types.ts#L14), but the original code looks like this

```ts
type Union<T> = T | (string & {})
```

Intersecting with `{}` makes the `string` type **something that is not a derivation of the string literal type**.

`{}` means any non-null value. This makes it a very loose type that can accept non-empty object literals.

```ts
const obj: {} = {} // ok
const str: {} = 'string' // ok
const nul: {} = null // error
```

Also, using `{}` with intersection types can cause strange behavior.

```ts
const color = (val: 'red' | {}) => {}

// Intellisense only for `red`, but accepts non-null
color('red') // ok
color('yellow') // ok
color(100) // ok
color(null) // error
```

In the above example, the IntelliSense is applied as if there were no `{}`, but accepts anything without `null`.

The above example show that `(string & {})` works well.

As a side note, an empty object literal can be represented as follows

```ts
type EmptyObject = Record<string, never>

const a: EmptyObject = {} // ok
const b: EmptyObject = { a: 1 } // error
const c: EmptyObject = null // error
```

## String vs string

In TypeScript, `String` stands for a `String` object.
On the other hand, `string` represents a string type, so they are different.

```ts
const a = (str: string) => {}
const b = (Str: String) => {}

a('') // ok
a(new String('')) // error

b('') // ok
b(new String('')) // ok
```

You can assign a `string` type to a `String` object type, but not the other way around.

Also, [Official TypeScript Reference: Do's and Don'ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html#general-types) states that.

> Donâ€™t ever use the types `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, or `Object` These types refer to non-primitive boxed objects that are almost never used appropriately in JavaScript code.

They say you have to use `string` unless there is a specific reason not to.

On the other hand, `{}` is so `ban-types` in ESLint that you should basically never use either.

In a hacky situation like this, it's better to use the `String` object type, because it's easier to understand.
