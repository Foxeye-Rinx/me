## Getting Started

Sometimes you want to get a specific element of an array or string. For example, if you want to get the first element of an array, how do you do that?

```ts
const sales = [100, 200, 300, ...]

const head = sales[0]
const [head2, ..._] = sales
const head3 = sales.slice(0, 1)[0]
```

There are many ways to do this, such as specifying subscripts or using [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

Let's see the result of TypeScript type inference.

```ts
sales // number[]

head // number
head2 // number
head3 // number
```

This is correct in this case, because it is type of `number`. What about the following?

```ts
const sales: number[] = []
```

Of course, in this case, it will still be inferred as `number`.
This is in spite of the fact that the value retrieved is `undefined` since accessing an empty array.

This does not change the result if you type-annotate the empty array as follows:

```ts
const sales: number[] | [] = []
```

No, no, no. You may think it is strange to use `number[]` for an empty array in the first place. However, there is no compilation error, and this is a common case.
For example, if you are expecting `number[]` as an argument to a function, an empty array will be accepted without any problem. When retrieving elements using subscripts, etc., you have to be very conscious of type safety, even in TypeScript.

In this article, I will introduce such type-safe retrieval of array and string elements.

## Conclusion

To conclude first, I have published a function project of [fonction](https://github.com/TomokiMiyauci/fonction), which is a functional utility package, so please use it.
It is TypeScript-first, and supports multiple runtimes such as `Deno`, `Node.js`, and browsers, so it can be used in basically any environment.

In addition to the `head` function for retrieving the first element of a `string` or `Array`, it implements various other pure functions such as `last` for the end element, `init` for other than the end element, `tail` for other than the first element, etc. Please check it out.

## head function definition

Let's define a function as `head` to get the first element in a type-safe manner.
The name `head` is based on the `head` function in `Haskell`. Although I say `type-safe`, the correct value is obtained in the implementation, so `undefined` should be inferred depending on the value.

There are other ways to do this, such as returning a class of type Maybe instead of `undefined`, but here I will use a function that returns the elements of the array as they are.
If I add `undefined` as Union types to the return value, it seems to be good.

```ts
const head = <T extends unknown[]>(val: T): T[number] | undefined => head[0]
```

Now, if you give `string[]` as an argument, you'll get `string | undefined` and the inferred types.

```ts
const val = ['hello', 'world'] // string[]
head(val) // string | undefined
head([]) // undefined
head([] as []) // undefined
```

Note that at this point, if you pass an empty array of type `[]` or `never[]`, only `undefined` will be inferred, which is correct.

Arrays don't seem to be a problem by themselves, TypeScript has `Tuple types`.
Let's deal with that as well.

Tuples are not necessarily `readonly`, but since tuples are often defined using the `const` assertion, I'll support `readonly` first.
Since I can't accept `readonly` types at this point, extend the generics.

```ts{1}
const head = <T extends readonly unknown[]>(val: T): T[number] | undefined =>
  head[0]
```

Just add the `readonly` signature to the generics. Now you can get `readonly` values in arrays.

```ts
const readonlyArray = ['hello', 'world'] as readonly string[]
head(readonlyArray) // string | undefined
```

Now that we're ready, let's see what happens when we receive a tuple in our current function.

```ts{1,3}
const head = <T extends readonly unknown[]>(val: T): T[number] | undefined => head[0]

const tuple = ['hello', 'world'] as const // readonly ['hello', 'world']
head(tuple) // "hello" | "world" | undefined
```

All elements of the tuple and `undefined` are now enumerated in Union type. That's because `T[number]` enumerates its elements with Union type for things like arrays.
For example, `(string | number)[][number]` is type-inferred as `string | number`, so I didn't care about it in the case of arrays.
However, in the case of a tuple, since it is ordered, it is not appropriate for elements other than the first to be type-inferred.
Therefore, we will use [`Conditional Types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html) to make sure that we get the correct type inference.

```ts{3}
const head <T extends readonly unknown[]> = (val: T): T extends readonly [infer U, ...infer _]
  ? U
  : T[0] | undefined => val[0] as any
```

TypeScript's type system allows for a kind of pattern matching, depending on the data structure.
If you have a tuple with the structure `[infer U, . ..infer _]`, and `Conditional Types` is used to make a conditional branch for type inference in the case of arrays and tuples.
Incidentally, `[infer U, . . infer _]` can recognize a tuple with a single element such as `[string]` as a pattern.

Also, the `infer` signature allows you to use the type inferred by the conditional branch as the result of type inference.
In other words, with `infer U`, if the type is a tuple, the type of the first element is used as `U` for the type inference result.

If it does not match the pattern, it will be used as an array, and the element type and `undefined` will be inferred as Union type.
The reason why the return type of the implementation is set to `any` is that the type inference of the return value of the implementation and the return type of the function no longer match due to `Conditional Types`. (The return value of the function is now more detailed.)

There are several ways to work around this, but for now we'll assume `any`.

The return type is getting messy, so I split the implementation and the type definition as follows:

```ts{6}
type Head<T extends readonly unknown[]> = T extends readonly [infer U, ...infer _]
  ? U
  : T[0] | undefined

const head = <T extends readonly unknown[]>(val: T): Head<T> =>
  val[0] as Head<T>
```

The type of the implementation we just `any`, can be defined without `any` by making it the same as the return value of the function, as shown above.

The result of using this function is as follows:

| type of argument             | argument                | type of return value                        | return value |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `string[]`                   | ['hello', 'world']      | `string` &#124; `undefined`                 | 'hello'      |
| (`string` &#124; `number`)[] | ['hello', 'world', 100] | `string` &#124; `number` &#124; `undefined` | 'hello'      |
| `['hello', 100]`             | ['hello', 100]          | `hello`                                     | 'hello'      |
| `never[]` &#124; `[]`        | []                      | `undefined`                                 | undefined    |

I hope this has made the function quite easy to use.

## Support for strings

The `head` function only targets tuples and arrays, but we want to target strings as well.
Packages that implement the `head` function, such as [rambda#head](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#head), also target strings (though with weaker type inference).

The `Haskell` `head` function also takes `[Char]` as an argument.(However, the `head` function of `Haskell` has some differences, such as throwing an exception if an empty array is passed, so we are not aiming to follow it strictly.)

Now, before processing the string, we check the expected value. The processing of strings in the `head` function should have the following specifications.

| type of argument | argument | type of return value | return value |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `string`         | 'hello'  | `string`             | 'h'          |
| `string`         | ''       | `string`             | ''           |
| `'hello'`        | 'hello'  | `h`                  | 'h'          |
| `''`             | ''       | `''`                 | ''           |

Only two patterns are considered. If a `string` argument is applied, the type `string` will be inferred, and if a string constant is applied, the first character of the string will be type-inferred.
This can be achieved with [`Template Literal Types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html), available since 4.1 of TypeScript.
`Template Literal Types` are simply template literals that can be used with types.

Also, strings, as a data structure, can have a complete type representation by distinguishing between empty characters and others.

First, let's look at the following types

```ts
type Head<T extends string> = T extends `${infer L}${string}` ? L : never
```

The `Template Literal Types` allow you to match non-empty characters as the data structure of a string.
This means the following results.

| argument types | return types |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `string`       | `never`      |
| `''`           | `never`      |
| `'h'`          | `'h'`        |
| `'hello'`      | `'h'`        |

The type `never` was inferred if it was an empty string or a `string`, otherwise the beginning of the string was inferred.

Now, `${infer L}${string}`, which is a `Template Literal Types`, turns out to represent a match against a string of one or more characters. (JavaScript and TypeScript do not explicitly distinguish between character and strings.
(JavaScript and TypeScript do not explicitly distinguish between characters and strings.)

By the way, if you refer to the backward part of the string data structure, the following result is obtained.

```ts
type Head<T extends string> = T extends `${string}${infer R}` ? R : never
```

| argument types | return types |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `string`       | `never`      |
| `''`           | `never`      |
| `'h'`          | `''`         |
| `'hello'`      | `'ello'`     |

The result is a little confusing in the case of a single character, but the point is that you can get any string except the first one.

With this knowledge so far, you can write the correct type inference. It will look something like this

```ts
type Head<T extends string> = T extends `${infer L}${string}`
  ? L
  : T extends ''
  ? ''
  : string
```

You can see it now. `${infer L}${string}` didn't match only the empty character and the `string` type, so I just put it after `Conditional Types`.

If it is a string of one or more characters, it is the first character; if it is an empty string, it is an empty string; otherwise, it is a `string` type

If you combine this type expression with the array type, you get the following:

```ts
type Head<T extends readonly unknown[] | string> = T extends string
  ? T extends `${infer F}${string}`
    ? F
    : T extends ''
    ? ''
    : string
  : T extends readonly [infer U, ...infer _]
  ? U
  : T[0] | undefined
```

Of course, this type can also be split into `string` and `array`.

```ts{11,13}
type HeadString<T extends string> = T extends `${infer L}${string}`
  ? L
  : T extends ''
  ? ''
  : string

type HeadArray<T extends readonly unknown[]> = T extends readonly [infer U, ...infer _]
  ? U
  : T[0] | undefined

type Head<T extends readonly unknown[] | string> = T extends string
  ? HeadString<T>
  : T extends readonly unknown[]
  ? HeadArray<T>
  : never
```

Splitting types is good from the point of view of readability.
But as shown above, `HeadString` can only accept `string` types, so we need to distinguish cases such as when `T` is a `string`.
The same is true for `HeadArray`.

Considering these features, splitting the type may not be of much benefit for non-recursive types.

However, the `Head` type itself is useful. If you `export` this type from a module, you can use it as a type to infer the first element from `string` or `unknown[]`.
By separating the implementation from the type definition, you can create a generic types definition.

The implementation also looks like this

```ts
const head = <T extends readonly unknown[] | string>(val: T): Head<T> => {
  const _head = val[0]
  return Array.isArray(val) ? _head : _head ?? ''
} as Head<T>
```

In the case of a string, we want to return an empty string, not `undefined`, so we split the case.
Now we have a `head` function with strict type inference.

## Overload

Now, up until now, I have explained this by splitting the types and implementations as the types have become bloated.
You can do the same thing using a mechanism called [overload](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/by-example.html#overloaded-functions).

By using overloading, you can define multiple types for a function.

There are several notations for defining functions in JavaScript and TypeScript.
Let's take a look at `function declaration` and `arrow function` overloads in each notation.

### Function declaration

Function declaration are the oldest and most common way to define a function. It is done using the `function` keyword.

```ts
function head(val: string) {
  return val[0]
}
```

A detailed description of function declaration is beyond the scope of this article, but they have the following features:

Functions defined in function declaration are rolled up to the global scope. This behavior is sometimes referred to as hoisting.
Also, the `this` of a function defined in a function declaration is determined at runtime. In other words, the value of `this` differs depending on the caller of the function.
Furthermore, generators can be written in function declaration.

Overload in a function declaration can be written as follows. If you replace the previous `head` function, it would look like this.

```ts
function head<T extends string>(
  val: T
): T extends `${infer F}${string}` ? F : T extends '' ? '' : string
function head<T extends readonly unknown[]>(
  val: T
): T extends readonly [infer U, ...infer _] ? U : T[0] | undefined

function head(val: string | unknown[]) {
  const _head = val[0]
  return Array.isArray(val) ? _head : _head ?? ''
}
```

You can write the type definition and implementation of a function separately. This is easy to understand, isn't it?

### Arrow functions

Arrow functions are available since ES6 and are an alternative syntax for function expressions. (Not function declaration)
According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), it has the following features.

> - Does not have its own bindings to `this` or `super`, and should not be used as methods.
> - Does not have `arguments`, or `new.target` keywords.
> - Not suitable for `call`, `apply` and `bind` methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
> - Can not be used as constructors.
> - Can not use `yield`, within its body.

Function declaration is the most common notation (even Deno's Standard Library is mostly in this notation).
On the other hand, arrow functions have the above restrictions, but in other situations, functions can be defined concisely.

Also, I think I read somewhere that overloading is not possible with Arrow functions, but it is.
It looks like this:

```ts{10}
const head: {
  <T extends string>(val: T): T extends `${infer F}${string}`
    ? F
    : T extends ''
    ? ''
    : string
  <T extends unknown[]>(val: T): T extends readonly [infer U, ...infer _]
    ? U
    : T[0] | undefined
} = (val: string | unknown[]): any => {
  const _head = (val as string | unknown[])[0]
  return Array.isArray(val) ? _head : _head ?? ''
}
```

As with function declaration, you can write them separately in `string` and `unknow[]`. The only difference is that, as highlighted, the return type of the implementation must be `any`.
This is because, as mentioned above, the return type of the overload and the return type of the implementation will diverge.

Also, although it doesn't make much sense, you can cut out the overload part into a `type`.

```ts
type Head = {
  <T extends string>(val: T): T extends `${infer F}${string}`
    ? F
    : T extends ''
    ? ''
    : string
  <T extends unknown[]>(val: T): T extends readonly never[] | []
    ? undefined
    : T extends readonly [infer U, ...infer _]
    ? U
    : T[0] | undefined
}
const head: Head = (val: string | unknown[]): any => {
  const _head = (val as string | unknown[])[0]
  return Array.isArray(val) ? _head : _head ?? ''
}
```

This `Head` alias is significantly less versatile. It can only be used as a type annotation for functions.
There is a big difference in type generality between a type definition and an implementation defined separately without overload.

overload is tightly coupled with the implementation of a function, so I think it is better to use it for limited purposes.

## Summary

I have introduced a method to retrieve the first element from a list structure in a type-safe manner.
In the process, you may have learned about `Conditional Types`, `infer` signatures, pattern matching in data structures, and `overload`.

This article was originally inspired by [type challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges), where I learned that the TypeScript type system is Turing-complete.
The type system has infinite expressive power.

Although it didn't come up in this article, you can also write recursive type definitions.
Recursive types have an upper limit on the number of recursions, but there are ways to break this limit through lazy evaluation.
I would like to write about recursive types in another article, so please look forward to it.

In this article, I introduced only the `head` function, but I think it will be useful to define `last` to take the last element of the list, `init` for non-tail, `tail` for non-head, etc. as an exercise.
