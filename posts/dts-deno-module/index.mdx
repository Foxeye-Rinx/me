## Introduction

[dnt](https://github.com/denoland/dnt) is the officially released module builder for Deno.
It allows you to build modules for NPM from Deno-based code.

This includes outputting type definition files, resolving import maps, etc.
It is packed with features to boost Deno-first.

I'll show you how to create a deno-first module using `dnt` and release it to deno.land/x and NPM.

As a side note, the whole article is based on the word "module" instead of the broad term library or package.
Please note that we do not consider the vocabulary to be strict.

## The difference between Deno and Node.js

By switching from Node.js to Deno, the codebase will see the following changes:

- Imports always require an extension
- URL schema import support
- No support for type definition files output tools yet.

### Imports always require an extension

One of the guiding principles of Deno is to avoid implicit processing.
We don't omit `.js` or specialize `index.js` as we could in Node.js.

The presence of this extension is very tricky.
The build tools in NPM generally don't do well with extensions.

### URL schema import support

Deno can import URL schemas.
It's a like a browser, but
This is a result of Deno's philosophy of browser compatibility.

### No support for type definition files output tools yet

If you are only using Deno in the first place, you do not need to output a type definition file.
However, when shipping dual modules, as described below, it is necessary to output for NPM.

Deno does not yet support a command to output the type definition file.
You'll have to make do with the [Deno.emit](https://deno.land/manual@v1.11.1/typescript/runtime#denoemit) Runtime API.

On the other hand, NPM `tsc` doesn't handle well if the import path has an extension.

It is very hard to output type definition files from Deno based code.

## The need for dual modules

Dual modules are here defined as modules for the NPM registry and the deno.land/x registry.
In this section we will explain why dual module development is necessary.

### Deno and the Node.js module system

Deno can make use of NPM assets. As mentioned above, Deno can import URL schemas.
This means that basically any module in NPM can be used via a CDN, as long as the module is provided in the **ES modules format**.

The most famous CDNs are [skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) and [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/).

These CDNs also provide type definitions, so you can develop with TypeScript.

For example, `lodash` can be used as follows.
By the way, lodash is provided by [module for Deno](https://deno.land/x/lodash), so you'd better use it, but just for refer.

```ts:cli.ts
import { first } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash'

first([1, 2, 3]) // 1
```

`deno run cli.ts`

On the other hand, what about the modules in deno.land/x? Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that Node.js will be able to use these.
This is due to the fact that Node.js's module resolution algorithm is closely tied to `package.json`.

As you can imagine, it's quite hard to rework the module system.

Also, it may be possible to import using a loader with `--experimental-loader`, but it's not practical.
For more information, see [Dynamic import with HTTP URLs in Node.js](https://dev.to/mxfellner/dynamic-import-with-http-urls-in-node-js-7og).

In addition, even with URL schema support, Node.js does not support TypeScript.

### Deno and dual modules

The above means that NPM assets can be used with Deno, but deno.land/x assets cannot be used with Node.js.
Not even in Deno's compat mode.

Currently, we have to accept this unidirectionality.

At this point, developers have two choices.

- Develop on Node.js as before and release to NPM, or use Deno via CDN
- Develop based on Deno and release to deno.land/x and NPM.

In a world without dnt, building Deno-based code for Node.js would have been quite time-consuming.

Personally, I think it's a good idea to use Deno as a base for new projects from now on.

## Build with dnt

Now, let's try to build it.

The actual repository is [TomokiMiyauci/isx](https://github.com/TomokiMiyauci/isx/tree/beta), so please refer to it.

I'll use a very small project as an example.

```bash
.
├── build_npm.ts
├── example.ts
└── mod.ts
```

It doesn't matter, but the `isx` in the example is a collection of "is?" that I'm owning.

```ts:example.ts
import { isFunction } from "https://deno.land/x/isx/mod.ts"

export function call(value: unknown) {
  if(isFunction(value))  {
    return value()
  }
  return value
}
```

```ts:mod.ts
export * from "./example.ts"
```

In this example we are doing two things:

- Import using the URL schema
- Import with extensions using file paths

To build this for Node.js, we have the following script:

```ts:build_npm.ts
import { build } from "https://deno.land/x/dnt@0.7.4/mod.ts";

await build({
  entryPoints: ["./mod.ts"],
  outDir: "./npm",
  package: {
    name: "<package-name>",
    version: Deno.args[0]?.replace(/^v/, ""),
    description: "<discription>",
    license: "MIT",
    repository: {
      type: "git",
      url: "git+https://github.com/username/package.git",
    },
    bugs: {
      url: "https://github.com/username/package/issues",
    },
  },
});
```

It is recommended that version information be passed from command arguments.

```bash
deno run -A build_npm.ts v0.0.1
```

This will output the build result for NPM under the directory specified by `outDir`.

```bash
npm
├── esm
├── node_modules
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src
├── test_runner.js
├── types
└── umd
```

By default, it outputs the ES Modules, CommonJS and type definition files, as well as type checking and testing.
Also, the `package.json` looks like this:

```json:npm/package.json
{
  "module": "./esm/main.js",
  "main": "./umd/main.js",
  "types": "./types/main.d.ts",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "name": "<package-name>",
  "description": "<discription>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/username/package.git"
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/username/package/issues"
  },
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./esm/main.js",
      "require": "./umd/main.js",
      "types": "./types/main.d.ts"
    }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test_runner.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {
    "chalk": "4.1.2"
  }
}
```

The output will contain the meta-information you specified in the `package` field of the build script, as well as the entry points and dependencies.

Now that it's ready to publish, you can publish it with `npm publish` or similar.

### dnt and dependencies

Let's see how the dependencies have been resolved. In the example, we were using an external module called `isx`.
However, the `dependencies` field in `package.json` is empty.

Dependencies are not always the same in NPM, so by default dnt are fetched and included in the artifacts.

For example, under the `esm` directory:

```bash
npm
└── esm
  ├── example.js
  ├── main.js
  ├── package.json
  └── deps
    └── deno_land_x_isx_v1_0_0-beta_17
```

The dependencies have been placed under `deps`. Also, dependency references are rewritten to match the file structure.

```js:example.js
import { isFunction } from "./deps/deno_land_x_isx_v1_0_0-beta_17/mod.js";
export function safeCall(value) {
    if (isFunction(value)) {
        return value();
    }
    return value;
}
```

Note that the type definitions of dependencies are placed under `types`.

```bash
npm
└── types
    ├── deps
    │   └── deno_land_x_isx_v1_0_0-beta_17
    ├── example.d.ts
    └── main.d.ts
```

It's fantastic.

### Mapping dependencies

You can also map dependencies.
The previous module `isx` is hosted at deno.land/x, but we'll change it to `isxx`, which is hosted at NPM [^1].

[^1]: Both are my own, namespaced differently.

Change the build script.

```ts:build_npm.ts{6-11}
import { build } from "https://deno.land/x/dnt@0.7.4/mod.ts";

await build({
  entryPoints: ["./main.ts"],
  outDir: "./npm",
  mappings: {
    "https://deno.land/x/isx/mod.ts": {
      name: "isxx",
      version: "1.0.0-beta.17 ",
    },
  },
  ...
});
```

Map the `mappings` field to the name of the NPM module.
The build should now look something like this:

```json:package.json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "isxx": "1.0.0-beta.17 "
  },
}
```

It was added to the `dependencies` field in `package.json` and no dependency fetch was performed.

When used with Node.js, pre-bundling dependencies can easily lead to double bundling.

Therefore, if the same module exists in NPM, it is better to use the mapping as much as possible.

### Deno.shim injection

The global context of Deno is different from that of Node.js.
Therefore Deno specific programs will not work in Node.js.

dnt provides a solution for them as well.

For example, consider a program that uses `fetch`.

```ts:example.ts
async function fetchHello() {
  const req = await fetch("https://miyauchi.dev/")
  const html = await req.text()

  return html
}
```

Deno supports `fetch`, but Node.js does not.

For this code, dnt will inject [Deno shim](https://github.com/denoland/deno.ns) by default.

Building this code will result in something like this:

```js:exmaple.js{1,3}
import * as denoShim from "deno.ns";
export async function fetchHello() {
    const req = await denoShim.fetch("https://miyauchi.dev/");
    const html = await req.text();
    return html;
}
```

```json:package.json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "deno.ns": "0.7.3"
  },
}
```

The `deno.ns` module makes it possible to run Node.js as well.

You can also disable the injection of deno shim by placing a `// deno-shim-ignore` comment above the code.

```ts:example.ts{2}
async function fetchHello() {
  // deno-shim-ignore
  const req = await fetch("https://miyauchi.dev/")
  const html = await req.text()

  return html
}
```

In addition to this, dnt also supports multiple entry points and the generation of `bin` scripts.

## Release flow for dual modules

This concludes my introduction to dnt, but we will now discuss some of the practical problems.

The first problem is probably the release flow.
We have to release to two registries and we don't want to release manually.

Deno originally recommended using GitHub's webhook to release third party modules. Please refer to [Publish a module](https://deno.land/x) for more information.

You can configure the webhook to be triggered by the generation of a GitHub release tag.

It's natural to do the same for the release to NPM.

GitHub Actions would look something like this:

```yaml
name: relase-node

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        deno: [1.16.0]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1
        with:
          deno-version: ${{ matrix.deno }}

      - name: Get tag version
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        id: version
        run: echo ::set-output name=TAG_VERSION::${GITHUB_REF/refs\/tags\//}

      - name: npm build
        run: deno run -A build_npm.ts ${{steps.version.outputs.TAG_VERSION}}

      - uses: apexskier/github-semver-parse@v1
        id: semver
        with:
          version: ${{steps.version.outputs.TAG_VERSION}}

      - name: Set tag
        id: tag
        run: |
          DIRTY_PRELELEASE=${{steps.semver.outputs.prerelease}}
          PRELEREASE=${DIRTY_PRELELEASE%.*}

          [ "$PRELEREASE" = "" ] && TAG="latest" || TAG=$PRELEREASE

          echo ::set-output name=RELEASE_TAG::$TAG

      - uses: JS-DevTools/npm-publish@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          package: ./npm/package.json
          tag: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.RELEASE_TAG }}
```

Parsing the release tag is a bit more complicated, but what we are doing is simple.
For example, let's say a v1.1.0 tag is issued.

We'll extract `v1.1.0` from the context of GitHub Actions and make it the version in `package.json`.

In the previous example, you can replace the version string with `Deno.args[0]? .replace(/^v/, "")` to convert the version string [^2].

[^2]: You can of course convert it on GitHub Actions, though.

We then parse the semver to derive the NPM release tag.
Normally, you'd just add the `latest` tag, but if it's a pre-release, you'll need to add a tag for it.

This is a bit of a pain, but the GitHub release tag generation allows you to release to two registries.

For reference, in addition to the above, I use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ja/v1.0.0/) to automatically generate GitHub release tags.
For more information, see [TomokiMiyauci/isx](https://github.com/TomokiMiyauci/isx).

## Deno and testing

Finally, a promotion.

When you move your codebase to Deno, you will face the problem of testing.
Deno provides by default a test runner and a standard [assertion module](https://deno.land/std@0.116.0/testing).

This is good enough for a certain amount of testing.
However, it is not as functional as `jest`, the de facto standard for Node.js.

This is why we are developing a jest like testing framework [unitest](https://github.com/TomokiMiyauci/unitest).

It uses the same `expect` syntax as jest, but it is Deno-first and very conscious of universality and bundle size.
It will also support a frontend testing environment, which is currently one of the biggest barriers to adopting Deno.

We invite you to try it out.

Also, when creating a dual module, there is the hassle of checking if the namespace is free in both registries.
We provide a service called [registerable](https://registerable.vercel.app/) which solves this problem.

It allows you to query each module registry to see if namespaces are available.

We hope you find this service useful as well.
