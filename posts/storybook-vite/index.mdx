## Introduction

Storybook can now be built using Vite, so let's take a look.

Switching from `Webpack` to `vite` for building in an iframe has the following advantages.

- Improved build speed
- Faster HMR
- Automated asset handling
- Compatibility with Vite project settings
- Access to Vite's plugin ecosystem

If you have few components, you may not see much benefit in speed.
Compared to `Webpack`, the speed to get the browser to display is dramatically improved, but
It will take some time to load in your browser. [^1].

[^1]: Storybook's bundle size is quite large.

On the other hand, the increase in time when more components are added will be contained.
Also, I think you will notice a clear difference in speed when rebuilding with HMR.

Personally, the biggest advantage of switching to `vite` is that it eliminates the need to configure asset handling.

With `Webpack`, for example, if you want to use `sass`, you need to set up a loader for it.
With `vite`, you don't need to configure TypeScript, CSS preprocessor, Static Assets handling, etc. because they are provided by default.

On the other hand, switching to `vite` may cause some Storybook add-ons to be disabled.
This is also true when using `webpack 5` with Storybook.
For projects that use many Storybook add-ons, it is recommended to switch after thorough verification.

By the way, we have confirmed that the following addons work.

- [@storybook/addon-essentials](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/main/addons/essentials)
- [@storybook/addon-links](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/main/addons/links)
- [@storybook/addon-a11y](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/main/addons/a11y)
- [storybook-dark-mode](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/storybook-dark-mode)

## Prepare the Storybook

I will use `preact` for explanation. The reason for using `preact` as an example is that there are a few points where you may get stuck in the `preact` environment.

First, create a project skeleton.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn create @vitejs/app <project-name> --template preact-ts
cd <project-name>
yarn add -D @mdx-js/preact
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm init @vitejs/app <project-name> -- --template preact-ts
cd <project-name>
npm i -D @mdx-js/preact
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

We also installed `peerDependency` for `storybook-builder-vite`, which will be needed later.

Next, we need to generate a Storybook template.
Of course you can build the environment from scratch, but you can generate the skeleton with the following command:

```bash
npx sb init --builder storybook-builder-vite
```

If you specify `storybook-builder-vite` as the `builder` option, it will also install [`storybook-builder-vite`](https://github.com/eirslett/storybook-builder-vite)

Now, the template is complete.

The directory structure at this point is as follows, excluding files that are not necessary for the explanation.

```bash
.
├── .storybook
│   ├── main.js
│   └── preview.js
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── stories
│   │   ├── Button.jsx
│   │   ├── Button.stories.jsx
│   │   └── Introduction.stories.mdx
│   └── vite-env.d.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Also, the following commands have been added to `package.json`.

```json:package.json
{
 "scripts": {
    "storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006",
    "build-storybook": "build-storybook"
  }
}
```

If you run the `start-storybook` command at this stage, it will fail to render `Introduction.stories.mdx`.

If you want `preact` to handle `mdx` files, you need to configure it.
If you choose `react` or `vue` for your project, you don't need to do the following.

Also, if you are in a `preact` environment and don't need to handle `mdx` files, you can delete `Introduction.stories.mdx`.
And you can skip the next section.

## Work with mdx files in Preact

In order to use `mdx` files in Storybook with `preact`, two changes are needed.

### Change the Storybook configuration file

Next, we will modify the `.storybook/main.js` file. We'll show you later how to make this file `.ts` to make it type-safe.

```js:.storybook/main.js{8}
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  core: {
    builder: 'storybook-builder-vite'
  },

  viteFinal: (config) => {
    config.plugins = [
      ...config.plugins,
      require('@preact/preset-vite').default()
    ]
    return config
  }
}
```

The `storybook-builder-vite` adds a hook called `viteFinal`.
You can change the settings of `vite` from this hook.
Change the plugin to use `@preact/preset-vite`.
By the way, in the original configuration, the following plugins are enabled.

- storybook-vite-code-generator-plugin
- mock-core-js
- vite-plugin-mdx
- mdx:transclusion
- storybook-vite-inject-export-order-plugin

Since we need to continue using these as well, we can use them by [Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to assign an array of plugins to `plugins`.

### Support for jsx inject

`@preact/preset-vite` will automatically insert `import { h, Fragment } from 'preact'` into the `[j,t]sx` file.
If you generate a Storybook with a template, the generated file will already have `import { h, Fragment } from 'preact'` declared.

Since the declaration will be duplicated due to automatic insertion, remove the above declaration from **all files** in the template.

Now that we are ready, let's run the `start-storbybook` command.
It should be rendered successfully.

## Make the Storybook configuration file type-safe

The Storybook configuration file is `.js` by default.
I want my configuration files to be type-safe at all costs, so I'll show you how to do that.

The current directory structure is as follows:

```bash
.
└── .storybook
    ├── main.js
    └── preview.js
```

The module system used by `main.js` and `preview.js` is different.

| File       | Module       | Ext         |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| main.js    | `Commonjs`   | `.js`       |
| preview.js | `ES modules` | `.[j,t]sx?` |

Since `main.js` is designed to be used with `Node.js`, it uses `Commonjs`.
On the other hand, `preview.js` is run in the browser, so it is `ES modules`.
TypeScript is also supported here.

We will change both of them to TypeScrit and use `ES modules`.
Incidentally, `Gatsby` and others have a similar structure, so you can use the same technique to define type-safe configuration files.

### Make main.js type safe

Since `main.js` is the entry point, we'll leave this file as is.
Create a new `main.ts` and copy the contents of `main.js` then rewrite `ES modules`.

```ts:.storybook/main.ts{10,11,12}
import preact from '@preact/preset-vite'
const config = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  core: {
    builder: 'storybook-builder-vite'
  },
  viteFinal: (config) => {
    config.plugins = [...config.plugins, preact()]
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
      config.build.chunkSizeWarningLimit = 1200
    }
    return config
  }
}

export default config
```

At this point, we add the code to change the `chunkSizeWarningLimit`.
The purpose is to suppress the bundle size warning at build time. There is no problem without it.

We give it a type annotation. The types are not provided by `storybook-builder-vite`, so you need to create your own.

```ts:.storybook/main.ts
import { StorybookConfig, CoreConfig, Options } from '@storybook/core-common'
import { UserConfig } from 'vite'
import { Weaken } from 'utilitypes'

interface CustomizedCoreConfig extends Weaken<CoreConfig, 'builder'> {
  builder: CoreConfig['builder'] | 'storybook-builder-vite'
}
interface CustomizedStroybookConfig extends Weaken<StorybookConfig, 'core'> {
  core: CustomizedCoreConfig
  viteFinal?: (config: UserConfig, options: Options) => UserConfig
}
```

We need to extend Storybook's `StorybookConfig` type.
If you want to extend a property that already exists in the `interface`, you need to set it to `any` once.

`Weaken` is a useful type provided by a project I'm working on [utilitypes](https://github.com/TomokiMiyauci/utilitypes).
It returns a type with `any` of the specified properties.

It is still `beta` at the time of this writing.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add -D utilitypes@beta
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm i -D utilitypes@beta
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

Now we can specify this type in the type annotation. The entire file will look like this:

```ts:.storybook/main.ts
import preact from '@preact/preset-vite'
import { StorybookConfig, CoreConfig, Options } from '@storybook/core-common'
import { UserConfig } from 'vite'
import { Weaken } from 'utilitypes'

interface CustomizedCoreConfig extends Weaken<CoreConfig, 'builder'> {
  builder: CoreConfig['builder'] | 'storybook-builder-vite'
}
interface CustomizedStroybookConfig extends Weaken<StorybookConfig, 'core'> {
  core: CustomizedCoreConfig
  viteFinal?: (config: UserConfig, options: Options) => UserConfig
}

const config: CustomizedStroybookConfig = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  core: {
    builder: 'storybook-builder-vite'
  },
  viteFinal: (config) => {
    config.plugins = [...config.plugins, preact()]
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
      config.build.chunkSizeWarningLimit = 1200
    }
    return config
  }
}

export default config
```

Next, we will import `main.ts` from `main.js`.
Since `main.js` is `Commonjs`, it can't normally handle TypeScript or `ES modules`.

To do this, we will use the package [`esbuild-register`](https://github.com/egoist/esbuild-register).
`esbuild-register` is the `esbuild` version of `ts-node`. There is no type checking. It is fast.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add -D esbuild-register
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm i -D esbuild-register
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

`main.js` will look like this:

```js:.storybook/main.js
const { register } = require('esbuild-register/dist/node')
register({
  target: 'node15'
})
module.exports = require('./main.ts')
```

So `main.js` is just an entry point, and the actual configuration can be type-safely written in `main.ts`.

## Make preview.js type-safe

There's not much to do with `preview.js`, since it's an `ES modules` and can handle TypeScripts.

- Change the file extension to `.ts` or `.tsx`.
- Type annotate the Storybook type

It will look like this:

```ts:.storybook/preview.ts
import { Parameters } from '@storybook/addons'
export const parameters: Parameters = {
  actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
  controls: {
    matchers: {
      color: /(background|color)$/i,
      date: /Date$/
    }
  }
}
```

Storybook provides a large number of files, so it was hard to find the type:sweat_drops:.

Now we can develop in a type-safe way.

## Preview the production code.

This is a extra. Sometimes you want to check the pre-built code.
This is especially true if you are switching from `Webpack` to `vite`.

For some reason, Storybook does not provide a command for previewing.
So you have to build a static file server yourself. It's easy, though.

If you use `Deno`, you don't need to install it [^2], so you can try it easily.

[^2]: It will stay in the cache.

```ts
import {
  createApp,
  serveStatic
} from 'https://deno.land/x/servest@v1.3.2/mod.ts'
const app = createApp()

app.use(serveStatic('./storybook-static'))
app.listen({ port: 8899 })
```

You can do `Express` or `fastify` or whatever. Just for reference.
