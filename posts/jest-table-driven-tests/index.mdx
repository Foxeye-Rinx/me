## Introduction

Table Driven Tests is primarily the recommended testing method in Go lang.
Define a complete test case as a table, including the input and expected results, and test iteratively against the test object.
We can write the test suite only once and pass in the test data.
If you have a lot of copy and paste when creating tests, it's likely that you can refactor your test cases into a table.

By the way, Go lang's [Official](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests) states:

> Writing good tests is not trivial, but in many situations a lot of ground can be covered with table-driven tests

jest also supports Table Driven Test, so I'd like to share how.

## How to write a test case

You can express test cases in two ways with jest.
Consider the following case where there is a conditional branch as a test target.

Function to convert \*.html other than index.html to \*/index.html

```ts:index.ts
import { dirname, join, parse } from 'path'

export const path2IndexHtml = (path: string): string => {
    const EXT = '.html'
    const INDEX = 'index'
    const { ext, name, dir } = parse(path)
    if(ext !== EXT) return path
    if(name === INDEX) return path

    return join(dir, name, `${INDEX}${EXT}`)
}
```

This function itself was used when the Server Side Generation implementation generating a file. Is it a rare case:upside_down_face:

### Test with an array of table

The first way to write it is to define the table as an array and pass it.
Write as follows.

```ts
describe.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)
it.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)
test.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)
```

Some objects have a same `each` method.
The specific test case is as follows.

```ts:index.spec.ts
import { path2IndexHtml } from '../src'

describe('path2IndexHtml', () => {
    const table = [
        ['', ''],
        ['index.html', 'index.html'],
        ['/index.html', '/index.html'],
        ['index.css', 'index.css'],
        ['about.css', 'about.css'],
        ['about/index.css', 'about/index.css'],
        ['about.html', 'about/index.html'],
        ['hoge/about.html', 'hoge/about/index.html'],
        ['/hoge/about.html', '/hoge/about/index.html'],
        ['aindex.html', 'aindex/index.html'],
        ['indexa.html', 'indexa/index.html'],
        ['/about/index.html', '/about/index.html'],
    ]
    it.each(table)('pattern1: path2IndexHtml(%s) = %s', (path, expected, fa) => {
        expect(path2IndexHtml(path)).toBe(expected)
    })
})
```

Describe the test case in a two-dimensional array. The order of the elements in the array is passed as an argument to `fn`.
Also, for `name`, specify the title of the test suite.
You can generate a unique test title by injecting parameters that follow the format of `printf`.
Please check [here](https://jestjs.io/ja/docs/api#1-describeeachtablename-fn-timeout) for details.
The parameters are passed in the order of the elements in the array.

By the way, if you pass a one-dimensional array, it will be converted internally as `[1, 2, 3]` -> `[[1], [2], [3]]`.

Also, the parameters passed to `fn` are type inferred for TypeScript.
In the above example, `table` is of type `string[][]`, so the argument to `fn` is inferred to be `... args: string []`.
If you want to infer as a tuple, add `as const` to `table` and it will be inferred well.

The `each` method also accepts generic types, so you can specify the type as follows:

```ts:index.spec.ts
it.each<string[]>(table)
```

When run the test, got the following output:

```bash
 path2IndexHtml
    ✓ path2IndexHtml() ->
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(index.html) -> index.html
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(/index.html) -> /index.html
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(index.css) -> index.css
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(about.css) -> about.css
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(about/index.css) -> about/index.css (1 ms)
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(about.html) -> about/index.html
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(hoge/about.html) -> hoge/about/index.html
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(/hoge/about.html) -> /hoge/about/index.html
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(aindex.html) -> aindex/index.html
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(indexa.html) -> indexa/index.html
    ✓ path2IndexHtml(/about/index.html) -> /about/index.html
```

The parameters are embedded in the test title. I was able to test various parameters with a minimal test suite.

### Test with tagged template literals

You can also represent a table with a tagged template literal.

The interface looks like this:

```ts
describe.each`
  table
`(name, fn, timeout)
it.each`
  table
`(name, fn, timeout)
test.each`
  table
`(name, fn, timeout)
```

Write the same test as the above example, it will look like this:

```ts:index.spec.ts
describe('path2IndexHtml', () => {
  it.each`
    path                 | expected
    ${''}                | ${''}
    ${'index.html'}      | ${'index.html'}
    ${'/index.html'}     | ${'/index.html'}
    ${'about.css'}       | ${'about.css'}
    ${'about/index.css'} | ${'about/index.css'}
    ${'about.html'}      | ${'about/index.html'}
    ${'hoge/about.html'} | ${'hoge/about/index.html'}
  `('path2IndexHtml($path) -> $expected', ({ path, expected }) => {
    expect(path2IndexHtml(path)).toBe(expected)
  })
})
```

The first line of `table` specifies the variable name. Subsequent lines describe the test case with the `$ {value}` syntax.
Even the `string` type must be enclosed in `${}`.

Since it is passed in the form of an object to the argument of `fn`, it is better to receive it by destructuring assignment.

If you use a parameter for the test title of `name`, you can access the variable in the form `$name`.

The advantage of this notation is that you can write test cases in the form of a table.
However, for test cases with a lot of `string`, `${}` and quotes are not very easy to see.

Also, in this notation, the type inference of the argument of `fn` becomes `any` type.
This is unavoidable because it is a tagged template literal and cannot accept generics.

If you really want to type, define the type in the `fn` function.

```ts:index.spec.ts
'path2IndexHtml($path) -> $expected',
  ({ path, expected }: { path: string; expected: string }) => {
    expect(path2IndexHtml(path)).toBe(expected)
  }
```

The test results will be the same for both,
so it's a good idea to use different notations depending on the test case and preference.
